**Computer Coding Club** (aka CC Club) is one of the official technical clubs of **MNNIT Allahabad** under SAC. We represent a group of passionate, energetic, and enthusiastic problem solvers and developers who feel interested in Competitive Programming, Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, Computer Science, and all other spheres of programming.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to try our best to spread this passion and interest in technology and innovation through computer science among the student community of MNNIT and beyond.

To achieve this, we organize a bunch of events which includes:
- **CC Classes**
- **Alumni-Industry Connect Sessions**
- **Hack36** (Flagship Hackathon)
- **Codesangam**
- **OPC**, **Weekend of Code**, **Turing's Playground**, etc.

## Our History

The club was **informally formed in 2010** wherein a group of students at MNNIT decided to spread the love for competitive programming among their peers. This decision eventually led to MNNIT being known for its **CP Culture** and MNNIT Teams reaching **ICPC Asia-West Finals**.

In **2014**, CC Club became an official technical club and **Dr. Shashank Srivastava** became our first Faculty Coordinator.

As time passed, **Web Dev, AI, Blockchain** and many other aspects of technology were included. By the **Batch 2018**, the flagship hackathon of MNNIT - **Hack36** was started, which has grown its own name and fame over the time.

## The Team

The CC Team consists of:
- **CC Representatives** (Final Year Students)
- **Design Leads**
- **Marketing Leads**

Every year, a set of students are selected from the **Pre-final Year** (Provisional CC Representatives) and **Second Year** (CC Executives). They assist in club activities, and those who show interest stay.

**Hierarchy:** Within each year, CC Club has a **flat hierarchy**.

---

## Vision

The vision of CC Representatives is that it is their duty to **give back to the institute** through the means of the Computer Coding Club. We aim to contribute our bit and also make sure that anyone from the institute willing and capable to contribute must be allowed to contribute for the best interest of our juniors and our community.
